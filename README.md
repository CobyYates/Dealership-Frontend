## About this project

This is a project for college. The project requirements were to create a Frontend build in Vue.js or React with 2 backend servers. One is a GraphQL built with Docker and the other is a RESTful api built with Node.js which is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://dealership-restful.herokuapp.com/) and the DB is hosted at MongoDB.

I built this project to portray a car dealership website where people would be able to add the vehicles in their inventory to the site and be able to do full CRUD functionality on both the GraphQL and RESTful databases.
